This is my first operating system, and it currently has no interactivity. Currently, there is just a small C kernel with a basic display driver, so experiment with it as you will.

It was developed mostly from guided tutorials from Nick Bludell's "Writing a Simple Operating System - from Scratch"

Dependencies:
	- binutils
	- NASM
	- (recommended) QEmu or Bochs

Compiling:
	- To run using QEmu or Bochs, use "make run" and "make run_bochs" respectively.
	- To compile the image file for use with another emulator, just use "make".
